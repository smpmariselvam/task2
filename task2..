write a blog on the difference between document and  window objects ;

anwser;
Document;
**It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
**its loaded inside the window
**its object of the window property
**All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document
**We can access the document from a window using the window. document
**The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
**Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed
by a window like this window. document.title
**syntax:

      document.propertyname;

**example:

     document.title :  will return the title of the document




window object;
The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser 
window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears 
on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

**It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   
**It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
**its the object of the browser
**Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
**We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
**The window is part of BOM, not DOM
**Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
**syntax:

window.propertyname;
**example:

window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
